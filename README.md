<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great portfolio templates available on web, however, sometimes we could like some simple and functional, so that later it is personalized as you like.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a web portfolio from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

### Built With

* HTML
* CSS

### Prerequisites

This project is aimed at people who know the basic concepts of HTML and CSS. If not, you can even follow it with a little intuition, and why not, you want to learn more about these web tools.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage
